## Open Source

### Ghost

Ghost is a small embeddable scripting language developed in Go. I started the development of Ghost not only to learn Go, but to also dispell and open black boxes surrounding programming languages and how they operate.

### Engine

Engine is a simple 2D game engine developed in Go using the SDL2 library. Engine is still in early development as the API is being planned around the offerings of SDL2 as well as continued improvements to Ghost itself.

### FusionCMS
PHP, Laravel, https://beta.getfusioncms.com

FusionCMS is the result of my work at efelle creative. FusionCMS was once a propietary CMS developed in-house, but was made fully open source with the development and beta release of version six. I was lead architect and developer, designing the system as a whole from the ground up based on my work with version five. Both the user experience and developer experience were paramount in the development of the platform.
