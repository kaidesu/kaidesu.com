I've always liked the idea of collecting knowledge; even as a kid I would spend hours creating catalogues of insect and dinosaur information to study. For this reason I read, a lot, but I can't say that I fully retained the things that I read. Once some time has passed and the topic is broached again either through conversation or in my mind, an exclamation goes off and I spend more time re-reading things that I've read in the past to refresh my memory. A lot of this time is not spent on reading or refreshing my memory however, but on _rediscovering_ and trying to trace the path I took before to find that information.

Our brains are amazing organic squishy machines that can do incredible things, but they're terrible at retaining information. It's not their fault though. We're constantly bombarded by information on a constant basis, every day of our lives. If our brains held on to every piece of information that came our way, we would undoubetly succumb to madness. It's not until we're presented with the same piece of information, multiple times, before our brain goes "okay, we'll hold on to this bit for future use."
