## 2021

### January 2021

- Created this changelog ✌️
- Added a new "wiki" section, to house collected knowledge for research and future reference. This was heavily influenced by the idea of maintaining a "digital garden," an idea of tending to personal digital notes and information. Took a lot of inspiration from [Gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/).
- Added a dark-mode option to the site while cleaning up colors and typography.
