## Open Source

### FusionCMS
PHP, Laravel, https://beta.getfusioncms.com

FusionCMS is the result of my work at efelle creative. FusionCMS was once a propietary CMS developed in-house, but was made fully open source with the development and beta release of version six. I was lead architect and developer, designing the system as a whole from the ground up based on my work with version five. Both the user experience and developer experience were paramount in the development of the platform.

### Caffeinated Packages
PHP, Laravel, https://caffeinatedpackages.com

Developed a series of packages for the Laravel framework, facilitating the development of large web applications. All packages combined have seen over **500,000 downloads** and the most popular package hitting **900 stars** on GitHub. Packages include adding modular plug-and-play support, permission system, theming system, menu generation, and improved asset management through PHP.

### Ghost
Go, https://ghostlang.org

Ghost is a small embeddable scripting language developed in Go. I started the development of Ghost not only to learn Go, but to also dispell and open black boxes surrounding programming languages and how they operate.

### Engine
Go, https://github.com/ghost-language/engine

Engine is a simple 2D game engine developed in Go using the SDL2 library. Engine is still very much in early development as the goal is to utilize and fully embed Ghost as the primary scripting language. This will effectively allow games to be fully developed utilizing Ghost. Currently it has Ghost embedded with the ability to render PNG images.
