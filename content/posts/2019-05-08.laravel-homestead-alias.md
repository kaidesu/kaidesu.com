title: "Laravel Homestead Alias"
draft: false

The following alias will make interacting with Homestead a lot easier.

```
# Homestead
alias homestead='function __homestead() {
    if [[ $@ == "config" ]]; then
        command open ~/Homestead/Homestead.yaml
    elif [[ $@ == "aliases" ]]; then
        command open ~/Homestead/aliases
    else
        (cd ~/Homestead && vagrant $*);
    fi
}; __homestead'
```

- `homestead config` will open your Homestead configuration file
- `homestead aliases` will open your Homestead alias file
- `homestead ...` referencing any vagrant command off of homestead will forward the command accordingly. (e.g. `homestead ssh` to SSH into your Homestead machine)
