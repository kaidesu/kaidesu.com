It's been a couple months since I've pushed an update to the RiveScript PHP package. I've hit a bit of a roadblock in development in two areas:

- Sorting triggers
- Loading multiple RiveScript documents into the interpretor

One of my top goals with the PHP interpretor of the RiveScript working draft, is to approach the code in an object-oriented manner that is easy to maintain and read in the future. While I do think that I'm on the right track, I felt my first attempt of the  implementation was messy. So, I've been working on a new restructured version which I've been pretty happy with so far.

## The Restructure

### Unit Tests
Right off the bat I started the project with unit tests. Tests are important to verify the interpretor is functioning according to the working draft based on a test Rivescript brain.

I also spent some time setting up a gulp process to automatically fire off all unit tests when I update any PHP file. This has been imensly helpful knowing whether I've broken/fixed/implemented a feature in realtime as I develop.

### Organization
I spent a lot of time on the organizational aspects of the new codebase, thinking of how all the pieces fall together.

I treat everything as an object (which is good if I'm building with OOP in mind!) in a cascading fashion. The modular state allows me to easily add additional features without having to scroll through hundreds of lines of code to add another `switch` statement (or the like) to a single file.

**Commands**, **tags**, and **triggers** each map back to their respective counterparts as outlined in the [Rivescript Working Draft](https://www.rivescript.com/wd/RiveScript).

While I still have a ways to go for complete coverage, I feel a lot better with the restructure knowing that it's covered by tests as well as flexible for future growth.

I'll write up another post in the next few days outlining the interpretor process in more detail.
